        <h1>Roll Bounce Privacy Policy</h1>

        <div class="effective-date">
            <strong>Effective date:</strong> December 28, 2025<br>
            <strong>Game:</strong> Roll Bounce<br>
            <strong>Package name:</strong> com.vonbase.rollbounce<br>
            <strong>Developer:</strong> Von Base Enterprises ("we", "us", "our")
        </div>

        <h2>1) Overview</h2>
        <p>Roll Bounce is a 2D endless runner game where a ball rolls and jumps to bounce on platforms and avoid obstacles. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
        <p>By installing or using Roll Bounce, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in two ways: (a) information you provide (if you use optional account features) and (b) information collected automatically when you play.</p>

        <h3>A) Information You Provide (Optional)</h3>
        <p>If Roll Bounce includes sign-in or account-related features (for example via Firebase Authentication), we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account identifiers such as an email address and/or display name (depending on the sign-in method you use)</li>
            <li>A unique user ID associated with your account (or an anonymous ID if you use guest/anonymous sign-in)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not use sign-in features, we generally do not collect your email address or profile details.</p>

        <h3>B) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>When you use the game, we and our service providers may collect:</p>

        <p><strong>Gameplay and app usage data (Firebase Analytics)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic information about how you interact with the game (e.g., session duration, screens viewed, in-game events you trigger, approximate performance information)</li>
            <li>Device and app information such as device model, OS version, app version, language/locale, and general region information (often inferred from network/IP)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Crash and diagnostics data (Firebase Crashlytics)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crash logs, stack traces, performance/diagnostic signals, and related device/app state at the time of a crash to help us fix bugs and improve stability</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Push notification data (Firebase Cloud Messaging)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A device notification token (FCM registration token) used to deliver notifications if notifications are enabled on your device and we choose to send them</li>
            <li>Basic delivery metrics (e.g., whether a notification was delivered/opened)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Identifiers</strong></p>
        <p>The game and/or service providers may use app instance identifiers (and similar IDs) to support analytics, crash reporting, and messaging. We do not use these identifiers to personally identify you by name unless you choose to provide account info (e.g., email) via sign-in.</p>

        <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate and maintain the game</li>
            <li>Improve gameplay, difficulty balance, and overall performance</li>
            <li>Diagnose crashes and fix bugs</li>
            <li>Provide sign-in/account features (if enabled)</li>
            <li>Send optional notifications (if enabled)</li>
            <li>Protect against fraud, abuse, and security issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Third-Party Services (Firebase / Google)</h2>
        <p>Roll Bounce uses third-party services provided by Google through Firebase, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Authentication</li>
            <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Cloud Messaging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These services may collect and process information as described above to provide functionality on our behalf.</p>
        <p>You can review Google/Firebase privacy information here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>5) Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p>We may share information in these limited situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With service providers (such as Google/Firebase) to operate analytics, authentication, crash reporting, and notifications</li>
            <li>For legal reasons if required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights/safety</li>
            <li>Business transfers if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale (you'll be notified if required)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining and improving the game</li>
            <li>Debugging and security</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Retention may vary by data type (e.g., crash logs vs. aggregated analytics).</p>

        <h2>7) Your Choices and Controls</h2>
        <p>Depending on your device and how you use the game, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disable notifications in your device settings</li>
            <li>Uninstall the game to stop future collection</li>
            <li>If you use sign-in features, you can request account/data deletion by contacting us (see "Contact Us" below)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Roll Bounce is not intended for children under 13 (or under the age defined as a child in your jurisdiction) unless explicitly stated in the store listing.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>9) Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>10) International Users</h2>
        <p>If you access the game from outside your country, your information may be processed in countries where we or our service providers operate (including the United States). Data protection laws may differ by region.</p>

        <h2>11) Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective date" above, and changes will be posted on the page where this policy is published.</p>
